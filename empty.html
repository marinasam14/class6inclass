    <h1>Class 6: Calculate the vote results for NY with Kamala Harris</h1>
    <h2>Goal: Calculate voting percentage and determine which candidate won and by what margin. It should look like this:</h2>
    <code>Kamala Harris won New York with 56.4% of the vote, about 13 points more than Donald Trump, who had 43.6%.</code>
    <h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll need to format the numbers a bit -- there's a powerful tool called <code>.ToFixed()</code> in Javascript you can use to round numbers</li>
        <li>You have all the data needed, but you need to figure out which variables to do and how to calculate it</li>
    </ul>
     <script>
        //Votes
        const kamalaVotes = '4583210';
        const trumpVotes = '3548552';
        
        //Convert the Numbers

        let kamala_converted = Number(kamalaVotes);
            console.log(kamala_converted);

        let trump_converted = Number(trumpVotes);
            // console.log(trump_converted);

        //Write a function to calculate the share of votes each candidate got and save it to variables

        let TotalVotes;
        let kamalaShares;
        let trumpShares;


        function voteShares(){ 
            TotalVotes = kamala_converted + trump_converted;
            kamalaShares = (kamala_converted / TotalVotes) * 100;
            trumpShares = (trump_converted / TotalVotes) * 100;

            let_voteDiff = kamalaShares - trumpShare

            console.log("Kamala Harris won" + " " + kamalaShares.toFixed(2) + "% of votes");
            console.log("Donald Trump won " + trumpShares.toFixed(2) + "% of votes" );

        }

        voteShares();

        //Write a console.log that prints out a message of the result

        console.log('Kamala Harris won New York with ${KamalaShares}')
